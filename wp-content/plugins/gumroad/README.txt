Make your Gumroad products available for purchase right within WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you embed Gumroad into your website, using our Overlay and Embed widgets: https://gumroad.com/widgets.

Zero coding knowledge is required. Once installed, all links to Gumroad will automatically open the Gumroad Overlay (lightbox popup).

For more information on how this plugin works, you can see a video on our Overlay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u80Ey6lSRyE.

You can also use shortcodes:

Basic overlay example: `[gumroad url="https://gumroad.com/l/DviQY"]`

Basic embed example: `[gumroad url="https://gumroad.com/l/GAPdj" type="embed"]`

Overlay that will automatically show the payment form: `[gumroad url="https://gumroad.com/l/DviQY" text="Purchase Item" wanted="true"]`

Overlay for an affiliated product: `[gumroad url="https://gumroad.com/a/919237747/llNDe" type="overlay"]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Your theme must implement **wp_footer()** in the footer.php file, otherwise JavaScript will not load correctly. You can test if this is the issue by switching to a WordPress stock theme such as twenty-twelve temporarily.

If the overlay doesn't get triggered on click (and your browser is redirected to a gumroad.com URL), please make sure that there is not extra code that is hijacking the click event (for example, a Google Analytics onclick event).

A popular known plugin that does this is "Google Analytics for WordPress". Try unchecking one or both of these options: 1) Track outbound clicks & downloads, 2) Check Advanced Settings, then make sure "Track outbound clicks as pageviews" is un-checked.

See the official Gumroad [overlay](https://gumroad.com/overlay) or [embed](https://gumroad.com/embed) documentation for further troubleshooting.
